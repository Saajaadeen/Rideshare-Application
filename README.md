# Base Bound

> Get Where You Need to Go, Together

Base Bound connects service members and base personnel through volunteer-driven ride-sharing. Free, community-powered transportation within your Air Force Base.



## 🎯 Overview

Base Bound is a volunteer-driven ridesharing platform designed specifically for Air Force base communities. Whether you need a ride to the BX, have an appointment at the clinic, or want to help fellow service members get around, Base Bound makes it simple and safe.

**Built by service members, for service members.**

### Key Features

- **100% Free** - No fees, no charges, no subscriptions. Community members volunteer their time to help each other
- **Base Security** - All users are verified base personnel. Rides stay within base boundaries
- **Real-Time Matching** - See available drivers instantly and get notifications when your ride is on the way
- **Community Driven** - Built on the values of service and support. Every ride strengthens our base community
- **Rating System** - Build trust through ratings and feedback. Recognize outstanding community members
- **Easy to Use** - Simple interface designed for quick pickups. Request or offer rides in seconds

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Sign Up
Create your account with your military email. Quick verification ensures everyone is part of our community.

### 2. Request or Drive
- **Need a ride?** Post your request with pickup location and destination
- **Have a car and some time?** See if anyone needs a ride and offer to help

### 3. Connect & Go
Get matched with a driver or rider. Coordinate pickup details through the app and you're on your way!

## 💪 Community Stats
